# ðŸ‘» Motoko Bootcamp 2023 

A huge thanks to [Iri](https://twitter.com/iriasviel) (ex-Motoko Bootcamp student | Motoko dev at Finterest) for contributing to the core project. 
You can use this repository as a starting point for your the [core project](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/motokobootcamp-2023) of [Motoko Bootcamp 2023](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/motokobootcamp-2023).

A few more things:
- To build the core project you should complete the code that is missing for the dao canister and webpage canister.
- Using this skeleton is NOT a requirement. This repository is only meant to help you get started. 
- The core project has to be submitted before the deadline - more infos on #submit.
- [Plug wallet is used] and we recommend using it for this core project to make your life easier: mainly because **Principal** for users will be the same between canisters (not the case with Internet Identity which makes the whole project more complex).

- There are probably some little bugs and errors - the code has been quickly hacked to help you get on track and focus on Motoko but this is far from being a perfect example.

## Instructions to deploy 
Install the necessary packages.
```
npm install
```
Start your replica
```
dfx start
```
Deploy locally 
```
dfx deploy
```

dfx deploy --argument "(record {
 accounts = vec { record { owner = principal \"$ALICE\"; tokens = record { amount_e8s = 100_000_000 }; };
                  record { owner = principal \"$BOB\"; tokens = record { amount_e8s = 100_000_000 };}; };
 proposals = vec {};
 system_params = record {
     transfer_fee = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 };
     proposal_vote_threshold = record { amount_e8s = 10_000_000 };
     proposal_submission_deposit = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 };
 };
})"

dfx deploy --argument "(record {
 accounts = vec {};
 proposals = vec {};
 system_params = record {
     transfer_fee = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 };
     proposal_vote_threshold = record { amount_e8s = 10_000_000 };
     proposal_submission_deposit = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 };
 };
})"

dfx deploy --network ic --argument "(record {
 accounts = vec {};
 proposals = vec {};
 system_params = record {
     transfer_fee = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 };
     proposal_vote_threshold = record { amount_e8s = 10_000_000 };
     proposal_submission_deposit = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 };
 };
})"

dfx deploy --network ic --wallet "$(dfx identity --network ic get-wallet)" --argument "(record {
 accounts = vec {};
 proposals = vec {};
 system_params = record {
     transfer_fee = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 };
     proposal_vote_threshold = record { amount_e8s = 10_000_000 };
     proposal_submission_deposit = record { amount_e8s = 10_000 };
 };
})"

## Live demo

There are 2 versions of this app deployed on the IC. 

- This example (without the backend completed so any request will fail): https://raisq-jyaaa-aaaaj-qazrq-cai.ic0.app/
- Completed version (with the backend completed - source code not available): https://xmfll-uyaaa-aaaah-ab2ja-cai.ic0.app/ 

## Common (strange) error
- When using Plug wallet you might encounter the following: "Uncaught (in promise) Error: There isn't enough space to open the popup" - if that's the case make sure to reduce your browser windows and give some space for the popup windows to appear.
